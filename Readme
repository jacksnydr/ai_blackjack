List of Important Files: 
deck.py, dealer.py,game.py, blackjack.py, bot.py, model.py, run_bot_game.py, train_bot.py, evaluate_bot.py, trained_blackjack_bot.pth

Dependencies:
PyTorch
matplotlib.pyplot
Everything else is included in repo
There are additional dependencies required for the beat_the_bot files, but these aren't integral to our project, and were more of an extracurricular exercise.
Instructions:
To get the project up and running, first download the two listed dependencies, these will allow for training and evaluation.
Next, run the train_bot.py file to build a model for use. This will create a .pth file with your trained data. 
Then, run the evaluate_bot.py file to see the win percentage of your model over 1000 games. From here, you can run run_bot_game.py to see the bot play hand-by-hand, or you can run game.py to play yourself.

Comments are included in all files

Important project files:
model.py: a pytorch model that chooses q values to play off of

bot.py: implements the model and makes decisions off of it, not runnable

run_bot_game: runs the bot using the information from model

train_bot.py, implements a training loop with 50,000 epochs, Adam optimizer, 0.99 gamma, 0.001 learning rate

evaluate_bot.py, runs the bot on the model post-training, shows results of win percentage, loss percentage, push percentage. This allows User to evaluate its performance.

Important Game files:
deck.py
dealer.py
blackjack.py
game.py
